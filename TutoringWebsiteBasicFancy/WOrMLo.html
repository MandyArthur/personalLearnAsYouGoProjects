  <p> Why do I write of Major Malcom? 
    <br> This is a man who lost members in his family since the young age of four. He doesnt seem like the kind of person who asks for trouble. I imagine at the time, going to school and enlisting in the army was the sign of good citizen. Research indicates that he was known he rose to become either "the youngest major in the Army", the youngest in the Cavalry,or one of the youngest in the Cavalry. 
    <br> After his army days, he seems different. he stands up for what he believes to be true and may have taken a bullet for it. It must have been difficult particularly when he there is an expensive lawsuit on your doorstep. 
    <br> He thens sees the opportunity seized by Famous Funnies and decides to form his own comics company. However, newstands were reluctant to a magazine of untested new material from an unknown publisher, particularly as other companies' comics titles were perceived as being "successful because they featured characters everyone knew and loved"
    <br> Despite his optimism, he suffered from continual financial crisis. 
    <br> Like most of the greats, he stood for what he beleived in and founded one of the greatest superhero publishers in History. Needless to say, I am DC comics fan. </p>

  <h3>Welcome</h3>
  <p> Miss Math Arthur was founded by <a href="https://www.tutorhunt.com/users/6064733624458/"> Mandy Arthur</a> in 2017. </p>
  <p>Prior to this, she had six years' of experience tutoring Mathematics from Primary to Alevel and Adult learners, Science from GCSE to Alevel Physics, English from Primary to GCSE level.
    She is a qualified Teacher of English as a Foreign Language and is enthusiatic about bringing real world events and experiences into her learning environment. Over the years' she has had many excellent from previous students, who have gone on to achieve their goal in a very short period of time. </br>
      </p>
  <p>At <a href="#"> Miss Math Arthur </a>, we are keen to provide a 5-star tutoring service to all our students. We are strong believers in the potential of students. After all, it was a great man who once said "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world" - Nelson Mandela. 
Here at Miss Math Arthur, we want to be a part of that positive change in our students' lives. </p>
  <p>We tutor students from a range of backgrounds, levels and ability. Where possible, we have been able to help students achieve beyond their expected goal. "The capacity to learn is a gift; the ability to learn is a skill; the willingness to learn is a choice." - Brian Herbert. We agree
       that the 'one size fits all' approach to teaching does not work for every student and therefore we tailor our service and ensure to match the right tutor to student for every case.</p>
 
    <h3> Subjects provided </h3>
       <p><b> Mathematics - Modules taught include Key stage 1 to Key Stage 5.</b>
         Primary school students are encouraged to join the One to One or Small Groups programme to ensure that they are fully prepared for 11+ and SATS tests. One to One GCSE Mathematics lessons are in high demand particularly due to the 9-1 Grade cirriculum requirements. 
         Progress from these sessions have shown better results than group sessions. During these sessions we aim to equip our students with more than the skill to answer questions presented in textbooks or past exam papers. We use <a href=http://edglossary.org/scaffolding>scaffolding</a> and <a href= http://beyondpenguins.ehe.osu.edu/issue/energy-and-the-polar-environment/questioning-techniques-research-based-strategies-for-teachers>key questioning</a>
         to ensure thorough understanding of a topic and application skills.

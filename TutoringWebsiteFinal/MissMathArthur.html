        <h2>About us</h2>
    
<p>    <b>Introducing Our Amazing Tutoring Services </b> </p>
    
  <p>  If you or your child are struggling with lessons or you feel you could benefit from extra support 
      and guidance with Maths, English or Science, then we are the people to call. </p>
    
   <p> Our team has a wealth of experience and we offer a wide range of support packages and tutoring 
       services so whatever your needs we can help! We offer a personalised and friendly approach in all 
       our services and aim to deliver an enlightening tutoring experience. </p>
    
    <p>“The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. 
        Intelligence plus character -<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr."> 
            Martin Luther King, Jr </a> 
        that is the goal of true education” and that is what we believe. 
    
   <p><b> “Children must be taught how to think, not what to think” –
        <a href= "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Margaret-Mead">Margaret Mead </a></b> </p>
    
   <p> We work with a small team of subject specialist tutors and believe that the ‘one size fits all’ 
       teaching and learning system doesn’t work. Our tutors can design and structure learning plans 
       where beneficial, will work closely with guardians by reporting on progress and we will signpost 
       students to detailed services, if required. </a>

     <p><b>What Subjects Do We Help With?</b></p>

          enjoyable and enlightening educational journey.  </p>
    <p><b>How We Operate </b></p>
    
    <p>Quality tutors shouldn’t just give answers to questions. We take the time to help our 
        students understand the topic so that if a similar question comes up in the future they 
        will have the skills and knowledge to confidently answer it. </p>
    
    <p><b>"Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn” – Benjamin Franklin</b></p>
    
  <p>  We help nurture a positive, resilient attitude in students by creating a safe space in lessons 
      where they can ask questions freely while also working towards their goals. This gives them a sense 
      of achievement, an appreciation of the progress they have made by means of self-reflection, and the 
      skills required to attempt exam questions without assistance. </p>
    
   <p> We organize instruction so that students are the producers, not just the consumers, of knowledge. 
       For more information on the benefits of this type of learning, please view this

    <p><b>“It’s not what is poured into a student, but what’s planted” – Linda Conway. </b>The new GCSEs 
        target a student’s way of thinking rather than the ability to put an answer on paper.</p>
    
    <p><b>Who Can We Help?</b> </p>
    
    <p>We are eager to help and be part of your progress. We know that everyone is different and how they approach a subject will have 
        a big impact on their learning experience. That’s why we tailor our tutoring to the learner, so they’ll 
        get the most out of the experience. </p>
    
    <p><b>“Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its
         whole life believing that it is stupid.” </b> The question I have for you at this point of our journey 
         together is, “What is your genius?”</p>
    
    <p>We also offer help and support for <a href = "https://www.gov.uk/home-education"> home schooling 
        students</a>, we are based in Maidstone, Kent, England but can also offer online tutoring as well.
        So, you don’t need to live close by to take advantage of our learning services. To find out whether our tutors can travel to your home for sessions, 
          please <a href="contactform.html">contact us</a>. </p>
    
   <p>Private tutoring services are a great way for both children and adults who suffer from learning 
       difficulties to attend to their learning needs, tailor lessons to suit them and build confidence. 
       Whether you need some extra tuition to help you overcome a challenging subject or simply want some
        extra support for an upcoming exam; our specialist team can help. </p>
    
    <p>We are happy to provide our services for children, teenagers and adults and we are also equipped to help
         students with special needs and learning difficulties like dyslexia, dyscalculia, ADHD, anxiety, and 
         depression. </p>
    

    
   <p><b><a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/17411-think-left-and-think-right-and-think-low-and-think">
     “Think left and think right and think low and think high oh, the things you can think up if only you 
       try!” </a></b></p>

    <p>Primary school students are encouraged to join the One to One or Small Groups programme to ensure that 
        they are fully prepared for 11+ and SATS tests. One to One GCSE Mathematics lessons are in high demand 
         particularly due to the 9-1 Grade cirriculum requirements. Progress from these sessions have shown better 
         results than group sessions. During these sessions we aim to equip our students with more than the skill 
         to answer questions presented in textbooks or past exam papers. We use 
         <a href = "http://edglossary.org/scaffolding/">scaffolding</a> and <a href= "http://beyondpenguins.ehe.osu.edu/issue/energy-and-the-polar-environment/questioning-techniques-research-based-strategies-for-teachers">key questioning techniques</a>
         to ensure thorough understanding of a topic and application skills.</p>
      
      <p> We look forward to working with soon. </p>

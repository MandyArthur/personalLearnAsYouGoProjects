# personalLearnAsYouGoProjects

Done: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MYSQL, PHP 
Watch this space for: Chart.JS, FlexBox layout 

These are projects that I have found/made up over time. 
A lot of the methods/features I have used are adapted from other people's projects. 
I haven't cited them but have in more recent projects. 

These are projects I was playing around with BEFORE I knew I wanted to a
job in Software Development.
